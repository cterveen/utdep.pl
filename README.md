========

utdep.pl is a script originally intended to get the dependencies of an Unreal Tournament package. It now also includes printing of the header, name table, import table, export table, object and some other information of maps. It can be used as a tool for itself, to get information for use in UT scripts it's better to use upkg.pm.
